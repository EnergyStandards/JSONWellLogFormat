# Accessing JSON Well Log Format files with JavaScript

As JavaScript has built-in JSON support, accessing JSON Well Log Format
files with Python is trivial.


## Example

The present example demonstrates how simple it is to create an
online log viewer using JavaScript and JSON Well Log Format files.
The viewer example uses [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).

To build:
```
npm install
npm run build
```

To run on local machine:
```
npm install
npm start
```

On online version of this simple JavaScript program is
demonstrated at wit the public Volve Dataset at
